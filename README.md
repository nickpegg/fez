# Fez Stuff

This is a collection of scripts and notes of me trying to solve puzzles
in the game Fez.

### WTF is Fez?

It's a sweet puzzle platformer. I picked it up for cheap after hearing about 
it and I don't regret getting it. The core game doesn't require you solve any
hard puzzles, but if you want to get all of the collectibles, there's some 
insane puzzles in your way.
